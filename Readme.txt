[https://folgad0.github.io/Game-Project/] 

## Description
Aquamess is a small comic book story to have a quick laugh, and have a relaxed gaming moment with a casual endless runner style og game.
Try reaching the furthest stage you can get to, and enjoy the intense soundtrack. Avoid all the obstacles by jumping through the gaps inbetween.

## (Main Functionalities) MVP
--> Pressing the space bar, or the arrow up button of your keyboard, will allow the character to jump up.
--> Obstacles are always coming with various random positions for an increased difficulty for the player.
--> When colliding with an obstacle the game is lost.
--> When the game is lost, a new window pops up displaying your score and allowing you to restart the game for a new try.
--> Try as many times as you want to reach new high scores and challange yourself.

## Backlog
--> Add an "Exit button" on the main menu, that allows you to start the game anyway. just a small joke.
--> Add a "story button" that will tell a bit of the background story of a married super hero and bring some story to the theme "Marvel vs DC"
--> Add a boss fight, uppon reaching a certain level from the platform level.
